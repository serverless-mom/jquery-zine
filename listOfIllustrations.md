general notes:  the jQuery witch is a 30's ish woman with premature grey in her long hair. she changes clothes based on the task at hand but is generally always seen wearing a broad-brimmed pointed black "witch's hat"

She has a lot of pockets, and often eats her meals on the go.

LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS

1. "calling on the power of jQuery" - the witch stands before a magical figure drawn upon the floor. to the left from our viewpoint, in the largest lettering, it says <script> and to the right it says </script>. in between is whatever magical pentacle or whatever you want to draw.

The witch holds a candle in one hand, and the flame tilts over in an unseen wind. Above, a cloud is forming, about to release the power of jQuery into the magic circle

4. The jQuery witch has been working on an old car she found. wearing coveralls and slightly grease-stained neckerchief, she turns the key of the truck, annoyed that nothing is happening.
