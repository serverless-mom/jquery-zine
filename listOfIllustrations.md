general notes:  the jQuery witch is a 30's ish woman with premature grey in her long hair. she changes clothes based on the task at hand but is generally always seen wearing a broad-brimmed pointed black "witch's hat"

She has a lot of pockets, and often eats her meals on the go.

LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS

1. "calling on the power of jQuery" - the witch stands before a magical figure drawn upon the floor. to the left from our viewpoint, in the largest lettering, it says <script> and to the right it says </script>. in between is whatever magical pentacle or whatever you want to draw.

The witch holds a candle in one hand, and the flame tilts over in an unseen wind. Above, a cloud is forming, about to release the power of jQuery into the magic circle

2. jquery witch rears back in shock from her spellbook as A dark, mis-shapen creature, formed of no solid corpus but more a mass of tentacles, presses its head through a magical book (like there's a magic portal in the book),

3. jQuery witch speaks into a magic mirror, saying "eye of adder and demon's bile, find me a header with a class of 'title'" as "<h1>" appears in the glass

4. The jQuery witch has been working on an old car she found. wearing coveralls and slightly grease-stained neckerchief, she turns the key of the truck, annoyed that nothing is happening.

5. (three panels) panel 1: jQuery witch speaks to a clay golem. The golem is broad-shouldered with huge arms and massive fingers ending in claw-like points (think of clayface from Batman the Animated Series) with a smooth, rounded head and a pair of flat round eyes and no mouth. jQuery witch says "go and find a div with ID 'total-price', make its contents bold, give it a red border, and then double its size" as she points off to the right

panel 2: the golem looks at a bunch of html (don't draw the HTML I'll add it from a screenshot, just draw like, a blank sheet of paper the golem is looking at) and thinks to himself "there's nothing here with a matching ID"

panel 3: the golem returns to the witch's side
witch: did you complete your task?
golem: ...
witch: I'll take that as a yes

6. the same setup as the previous strip, with the witch and the golem, but this time she's just finished using a tiny, leaf-shaped iron knife to cut a slit in the golems face where a mouth should be
witch: when I sent you to find divs, did you find anything?
golem: yes, I've got a list of everything I found.
witch: and how long is this list?
golem: zero
